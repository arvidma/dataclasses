# __eq__ identity check order differs from CPython 3.13

## Severity: INFO

## Description

The backport's `_eq_fn()` checked class membership **before** identity,
while CPython 3.13 checks identity **first**. Both are correct but
CPython's variant avoids an unnecessary class check when comparing
an object to itself.

## Original code (dataclasses.py)

Generated `__eq__`:
```python
def __eq__(self, other):
    if other.__class__ is self.__class__:
        return self is other or (self.x==other.x and self.y==other.y)
    return NotImplemented
```

## CPython 3.13 (reference)

Generated `__eq__`:
```python
def __eq__(self, other):
    if self is other:
        return True
    if other.__class__ is self.__class__:
        return self.x==other.x and self.y==other.y
    return NotImplemented
```

## Difference

CPython 3.13 checks `self is other` first (before the class check),
since an object is always the same class as itself. The backport did
the class check first, then used `self is other or (terms)` within
that branch. In the identity case, the backport performed an
unnecessary class check.

- CPython 3.13 `Lib/dataclasses.py`, `_process_class()`

## Resolution

Changed `_eq_fn()` to check `self is other` before the class check,
matching CPython 3.13's structure exactly.
