# Wrong bpo reference in commit message for InitVar

## Severity: LOW

## Description

Commit `6015afb` has the message:

> InitVar type parameter support (Python 3.8, bpo-33796)

The reference **bpo-33796** is incorrect. bpo-33796 is about
`dataclasses.replace()` being broken with ClassVar fields - an
entirely different bug.

The correct reference for InitVar type parameter support is
**bpo-33569** ("dataclasses InitVar does not maintain any type info"),
which was migrated to GitHub issue #77750.

## Correct history

- **bpo-33569** (GitHub #77750): Reported May 2018. `InitVar[int]`
  returned the `InitVar` class itself (via `__getitem__` returning
  `self`), so all type information was lost.
- **PR #8927**: By Augusto Hack, merged June 2019 for Python 3.8.
  Modified `InitVar` to store the type parameter.
- **bpo-33796** (GitHub #77977): About `dataclasses.replace()` being
  broken with ClassVar fields. Completely unrelated.

## Resolution

No code change needed. This is a commit message error that cannot be
corrected without rewriting git history. Documented here for reference.
